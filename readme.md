Summary of What We Did:
We created a simple to-do list application where you can:

Add new todos.
Edit existing todos.
Delete todos.
Store todos in localStorage to persist the list even after a page reload.
Overview of the Code:
1. Form Setup:
We defined input fields (title, description, dueDate, and priority) and referenced them in the code to allow users to input their todo information.
2. Creating and Storing Todos:
We created a Todo class (assumed to be in a separate file) to represent individual todo items.
We created a Project class (also assumed to be in another file) to manage the collection of todos for a specific project.
3. Adding a New Todo:
In the event listener for the form's submit button, we create a new Todo object based on the form data and add it to the myProject instance.
The new todo is then rendered on the screen and stored in localStorage.
4. Rendering Todos:
After every change (add, edit, or delete), the renderTodos function is called to update the displayed list of todos.
It loops through the myProject.todos array and generates HTML for each todo.
5. Editing a Todo:
When you click the Edit button, the corresponding todo's details are pre-filled into the form.
The editingIndex is set in the form's dataset to identify which todo is being edited.
Upon form submission, the app checks if editingIndex is set:
If it is, the app updates the existing todo.
If it isn't, the app adds a new todo.
6. Deleting a Todo:
When the Delete button is clicked, the corresponding todo is removed from the myProject.todos array, and the UI is re-rendered to reflect the change.
7. Persisting Todos in localStorage:
When a new todo is added, edited, or deleted, the todos array is updated in localStorage using localStorage.setItem("todos", JSON.stringify(todosArray)).
When the page reloads, the loadFromLocalStorage function extracts the saved todos from localStorage and re-renders them using the renderTodos function.
Explanation of Key Code Snippets:
loadFromLocalStorage:
javascript
Copy code
function loadFromLocalStorage() {
  const savedTodos = localStorage.getItem("todos");
  if (savedTodos) {
    const todosArray = JSON.parse(savedTodos); // Converts the saved JSON string back to an array
    todosArray.forEach((todoData) => {
      const todo = new Todo(todoData.title, todoData.description, todoData.dueDate, todoData.priority);
      myProject.addTodo(todo); // Adds each todo back to the project
    });
  }
}
Purpose: Loads the todos stored in localStorage when the page is loaded, ensuring the todos persist across page reloads.
How It Works:
It retrieves the saved todos from localStorage.
If there are todos saved, it parses the JSON string into an array of objects.
Each todo is added back to the project using the myProject.addTodo(todo) method.
renderTodos:
javascript
Copy code
function renderTodos(project) {
  const container = document.getElementById("todo-container");
  container.innerHTML = ""; // Clear the container

  project.todos.forEach((todo, index) => {
    const todoDiv = document.createElement("div");
    todoDiv.classList.add("todo-item");

    todoDiv.innerHTML = `
      <h3>${todo.title}</h3>
      <p>${todo.description}</p>
      <p>Due: ${todo.dueDate}</p>
      <p>Priority: ${todo.priority}</p>
      <button data-index="${index}" class="edit-btn">Edit</button>
      <button data-index="${index}" class="delete-btn">Delete</button>
    `;

    container.appendChild(todoDiv);
  });
  addEditListeners(project); // Add edit listeners
  addDeleteListeners(project); // Add delete listeners
}
Purpose: Renders the list of todos in the HTML container.
How It Works:
The todo-container is cleared first to remove any previously displayed todos.
Then, for each todo in myProject.todos, a new div is created with the todo's details and buttons to edit or delete it.
addEditListeners and addDeleteListeners are called to attach event listeners to the edit and delete buttons.
Form Submission (Add/Edit Todo):
javascript
Copy code
form.addEventListener("submit", (e) => {
  e.preventDefault(); // Prevent the default form submission

  const title = titleInput.value.trim();
  const description = descriptionInput.value.trim();
  const dueDate = dueDateInput.value.trim();
  const priority = prioritySelect.value.trim();

  if (title === "" || description === "" || dueDate === "" || priority === "") {
    alert("Please fill in all fields.");
    return;
  }

  const editingIndex = form.dataset.editingIndex;

  if (editingIndex !== undefined && editingIndex !== null) {
    // Update existing todo
    const todoToEdit = myProject.todos[editingIndex];
    todoToEdit.title = title;
    todoToEdit.description = description;
    todoToEdit.dueDate = dueDate;
    todoToEdit.priority = priority;
    delete form.dataset.editingIndex; // Clear the editing index
  } else {
    // Add new todo
    const newTodo = new Todo(title, description, dueDate, priority);
    myProject.addTodo(newTodo);
  }

  renderTodos(myProject); // Re-render the todos
  form.reset(); // Reset form after submission
});
Purpose: Handles both adding and editing todos when the form is submitted.
How It Works:
First, the form data is validated (making sure no field is empty).
Then, it checks if an editingIndex is set on the form:
If it is, the existing todo is updated.
If not, a new todo is created.
The list is re-rendered to reflect the changes, and the form is reset.
addEditListeners and addDeleteListeners:
These functions are used to attach event listeners to the Edit and Delete buttons of each todo:

Edit Listener: When an edit button is clicked, the corresponding todo's details are pre-filled into the form and the editingIndex is set.
Delete Listener: When a delete button is clicked, the corresponding todo is removed from the project.
Conclusion:
With these functions in place, the application allows you to manage a list of todos, including adding, editing, and deleting items. The todos are persisted in localStorage, which ensures they remain available even after a page reload.
